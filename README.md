# In October 2008 it all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 
which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
~~~
- A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly 
from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 

- Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party 
is still required to prevent double-spending.

- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
