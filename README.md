# Introduction - concepts and products
## October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) 
which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:
~~~
A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly 
from one party to another without going through a financial institution. 

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party 
is still required to prevent double-spending.

We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.

# Blockchain and BitCoin

* Assets over cryptocurrency
* Identity over anonymity
* Selective endorsement (consensus) over proof of work

# Appendix

## Bonus Lab : Let's bring up the Hyperledger Fabric!
Instructions below from thess URLs: 
* http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html 
* http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html
* http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

### Step 1
Only if necessary, execute the following three commands to remove existing Docker instances.
   * docker kill $(docker ps -q)
   * docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
   * docker rmi $(docker images dev-* -q) 
### Step 2   
    Instructions below come from the following URL: http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html  
    From a terminal window on your laptop, execute the following commands:
   * git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git into a directory on your laptop
   From that directory on your laptop (see above) invoke:
   * curl -sSL https://goo.gl/Q3YRTi | bash   
   * export PATH=<path to download location>/bin:$PATH  
  
### Step 3 
   * Instructions below come from the following URL:  
      http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html
      
   Bring up the Hyperledger Fabric: 
   * cd first-network
   * ./byfn.sh -m generate
   * ./byfn.sh -m up. //See full output from command on this link http://bit.ly/2yyTeIj
   * After checking the output, remember to run ./byfn.sh -m down.
   
 ### Step 4 (optional) Configurate your Hyperledger Fabric instance.
